# Leet Visualisation
Version 0.0

Ever wonder what progress you're even making on leetcode? Want someone to tell you what to do next to meet a goal? Want somewhere to even _write down_ your goal?

## Extension
This extension will visualise your progress on leetcode against the tags, languages and difficulty level to help you figure out what you might want to work on.

This is especially useful for people who never had the chance to take a Data Structures & Algorithms course (I didn't), such as bootcampers and self taught.

### Features
* Display progress for each algorithm and data structure that you have ever completed.
* Progress bars and pie charts to see what is missing, and what you could do next.
* `New Challenge` button sends you to an appropriate next challenge based on your overall progress.
* Write in a goal that can be parsed by Natural Language Parsers to help you focus on the best practice challenges
* See suggestions on where to improve, powered by NLP.
* Track your progress in different languages, or, all challenges cumulatively. 
* Over time, as you use the extension and allow it to time you, see your generalised skill for a problem type and language.
* Set yourself multiple goals and choose a new one any time.
* Match system dark mode

* If click on ext, and not on leetcode.com, show popup with link
* else, open side panel.

### Future Features
* Scheduled reminders to practice, even if you're not interviewing or doing contests.
* Log the time it takes to do a challenge (while extension is on).
* Problem translation into a language that isn't English?
